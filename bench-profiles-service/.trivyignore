# Trivy Ignore File
# This file contains vulnerability IDs that should be ignored during security scans
# Format: CVE-YYYY-NNNN or GHSA-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX

# HIGH severity vulnerabilities have been fixed by updating dependencies:
# - CVE-2025-22235: Spring Boot 3.4.1 → 3.4.5 
# - CVE-2025-49146: PostgreSQL driver → 42.7.7
# - CVE-2025-22228: Spring Security (updated via Spring Boot parent)

# MEDIUM and LOW severity vulnerabilities are allowed by the security gate
# No ignores needed - they don't cause pipeline failures
